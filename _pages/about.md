Hi, I'm Zahid. A computer science and engineering undergraduate (final semester) at Islamic Universtiy of Technology. I have a keen interest in Computer Vision and Deep learning. Currently, I am doing my final year thesis on "Automatic detection of violence from surveillance footage". I am active on [github](https://github.com/Zedd1558) and like to develop small projects as a hobby.
